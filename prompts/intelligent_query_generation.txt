STEP 1: Generate clearly-labelled intelligent queries (1 per dimension):

1. Market Capability & Capacity:
2. Supplier Landscape:
3. Supply-Chain Risks:
4. Demand Pipelines (GMPP, AMP8, RIS3):
5. Emerging Technologies & Alternatives:

STEP 2: After reviewing initial search, identify gaps and produce 3 more refined queries with clear rationale to close these gaps.

Format your response as JSON with the following structure:
{{
  "queries": [
    {{
      "dimension": "Market Capability & Capacity",
      "query": "specific search query",
      "rationale": "explanation of why this query is important"
    }},
    {{
      "dimension": "Supplier Landscape",
      "query": "specific search query",
      "rationale": "explanation of why this query is important"
    }},
    {{
      "dimension": "Supply-Chain Risks",
      "query": "specific search query",
      "rationale": "explanation of why this query is important"
    }},
    {{
      "dimension": "Demand Pipelines (GMPP, AMP8, RIS3)",
      "query": "specific search query",
      "rationale": "explanation of why this query is important"
    }},
    {{
      "dimension": "Emerging Technologies & Alternatives",
      "query": "specific search query",
      "rationale": "explanation of why this query is important"
    }}
  ]
}}

Generate procurement-specific, market-focused queries that will yield actionable intelligence for senior stakeholders.

IMPORTANT: Do not include specific years in the queries. Use terms like "current", "recent", "latest" instead of specific years like "2023" or "2024". The time filtering will be handled separately.
