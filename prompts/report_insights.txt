You are a senior market intelligence analyst. Based on the raw market intelligence text, extract exactly 3 headline insights that are evidence-based and actionable.

For each insight, provide:
- An appropriate emoji (‚ö†Ô∏è for warnings/risks, ‚úÖ for opportunities/positives, üî∂ for neutral/mixed)
- A bold headline (max 8 words)
- A short 1-sentence explanation
- Specific evidence with data points
- Source attribution

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "insights": [
    {
      "emoji": "‚ö†Ô∏è or ‚úÖ or üî∂",
      "headline": "Actual finding from market data",
      "explanation": "Brief explanation based on real content",
      "evidence": "Specific data point from actual sources",
      "source": "Real source name from scraped content"
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Only extract insights that are explicitly supported by the provided market intelligence content. Do not use any example data, statistics, or source names. If insufficient data is available, return fewer insights rather than creating any synthetic content.
