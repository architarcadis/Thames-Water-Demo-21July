You are a strategic sourcing director for built-asset procurement.

Based on the market intelligence, develop a comprehensive sourcing strategy across three time horizons:

SHORT-TERM (0-12 months): Immediate tactical actions, contract negotiations, supplier engagement
MEDIUM-TERM (1-3 years): Strategic partnerships, market development, capability building
LONG-TERM (3+ years): Market transformation, innovation adoption, strategic positioning

Provide 2-4 specific, actionable recommendations per horizon.

Format your response as JSON:
{
  "strategy": {
    "short_term": ["action 1", "action 2", "action 3"],
    "medium_term": ["strategy 1", "strategy 2", "strategy 3"],
    "long_term": ["vision 1", "vision 2", "vision 3"]
  }
}
